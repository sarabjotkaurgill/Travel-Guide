            <p>Diwali is a major festival of India celebrating the victory of good over evil. The meaning of the word Diwali is ‘lighted lamps’ so it is rightfully called the festival of lights. This festival is celebrated by lighting small ‘diyas’ and candles and burning fireworks and crackers. All this was done to celebrate the returning of Lord Ram to Ayodhya after fourteen years of exile. In present times all cities in India are brightly lit with dazzling lights with Diwali parties being organized for a fortnight before the main festival day.<br></p>

            <p>Diwali is as big a festival in India as Christmas for the West. The festive celebration continues for days with families getting together exchanging gifts. Prayers and rituals mark the festive spirit with children enjoying the special sweets and fireworks.</p>

            <p>Holi is a much-awaited festival in India with Indians as well as foreigners taking part by throwing colors and colored water on each other. Holi is celebrated on the full moon day in March with the commencement of the spring season. Though the festival is celebrated all over the country there are special celebrations held in Mathura & Vrindavan, the birth place of Lord Krishna.<br></p>

            <p>Holi should be celebrated with friends and family with natural plant based and non synthetic colors otherwise it can get very rowdy playing with people drinking ‘bhang’.</p>
